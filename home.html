      <h1>Personas & Storyboarding: The Envirobrite LED Task Lamp</h1>
      <span class='line'></span>
      <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>We were tasked with finding an interface somewhere in public space and
          interviewing three users about it. Based on those interviews, we created
          two personas and a storyboard to illustrate the user journey of one of
          those personas. With this task, I decided to choose...[drumroll please] a lamp. Why?
          Well, first, it is a lamp I love to use. But second, there are a few things that
          frustrate me about the interface, and I was wondering if others felt the same way.
        </p>
      <h2>The Interface</h2>
      <div class='column-container'>
        <div class='column'>
          <div class='column-align-inner'>
          <p>The selected interface is the LED Task Lamp, a desk lamp that is present
            in a common space in my house.</p>
          <p>It has several different modes, as well as a timer, and needs to be set up
            before it is used (as can be stored in a folded state when not in use).</p>

      <h2>User interviews</h2>
      <h3>The users</h3>
      <p>
        Interviewed users included one undergraduate student, one graduate
        student and teaching assistant, and one professional teacher. None of
        the respondents had seen or used the interface before.
      </p>
      <h3>The questions</h3>
      <h4>Behavioral questions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          What kind of work do you do?
          <ul>
            <li>All three said that they do a great deal of typing, writing, reading, and Zoom meeting while working.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Where do you work best?
          <ul>
            <li>
              Respondents prefer to work at a desk, but two responded that they
              also sometimes work in “soft seating.”
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Describe your workspace.
          <ul>
            <li>
              All respondents described their desk area; only one mentioned using
              a lamp. They described having their
              computers, a notebook or other paper, and books around their
              workspace at any given time. One noted having a lamp beside them.
              One respondent later stated that they never work with a tabletop
              lamp, but do sometimes work with lamps by soft seating.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          What time of day do you prefer to do your work?
          <ul>
            <li>
              Two respondents noted a preference for daytime work, though
              all said that they do work in the evening.
              One respondent preferred evening work.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          What kind of lighting do you like best?
          <ul>
            <li>
              All respondents said they prefer natural light. When asked to
              describe what lighting they prefer for evening work,
              all three said warm light.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Interface questions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          What does each circle do? (Describe what you can do with the button).
          <ul>
            <li>
              All respondents correctly identified the power button.
              Two respondents correctly identified the Mode button;
              one hesitated but eventually settled on “quality of light.”
              Respondents hesitated upon identifying the 1H/2H buttons;
              all three eventually identified it correctly. The arrow
              buttons were identified by two respondents to change the
              brightness of the light; one respondent suggested that it
              would increase or decrease the amount of time for which the
              light would stay on.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          What lighting mode do you prefer?
          <ul>
            <li>
              Respondents did not need to be prompted to answer this question;
              all three were forthcoming about their preference for the most
              yellow or warm light.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        When requested to set up the lamp, users paused to observe it before
        initially setting it up; one attempted first to stand it upside-down. One user
        did not initially plug the lamp in before trying to turn it on by pressing
        on the power button; the other two plugged the lamp in and then tried to turn it on.
        One user took a few seconds to find the power button; the other two found it immediately.
        Users were then asked to identify what they thought the buttons would do before pressing them.
        All users intuitively knew how to press the buttons. All three users tapped the Mode button several times
        while testing it; two did this immediately upon pressing it, while one paused to inspect the light difference.

              has been experiencing a lot of eye strain. He’s got a deadline tonight
              and wants to get back to work as soon as possible, but his eyes don’t feel
              super great at the moment, between his readings and his extended
              screen time.

              side.  They have limited space in their current room, since they’re
              trying to save on rent, and are missing personal interactions with their
              students a lot.
